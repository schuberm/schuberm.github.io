Welcome
------
This is an actively under construction site for my new lab in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department at the University of Ottawa. We're looking for students! If you are considering graduate school in Canada with interests in physics, materials science or computer science, take a look at our [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=25uBwAkAAAAJ&hl=en) and please feel free to contact me (samuel.huberman_at_gmail.com).
